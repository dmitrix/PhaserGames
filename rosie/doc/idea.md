## IDEA: A Tamagotchi Style Game about Rosie

Here's the reason behind the idea: I made all this pixel art of my sister's dog Rosie. I might as well use it in something interactive so why not a game where you have to take care of her? You have to do things such as feed her, let her sleep, take her on walks, etc... or else she dies or runs away or something like that. Since it will be a phaser game it will be single session so I need a way to make it seem fun in the short term. Oh, and a super minimalistic pixel art style. 32 x 32 pixels.

##Thing to do:
*folder and code structure
*sprite sheets
*....
